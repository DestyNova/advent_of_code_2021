# Advent of Code 2021

A collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) programming puzzles. I'll probably attempt most of these in Haskell since I'm still quite noobish and would like to start using it for practical projects. But I might add more languages later since the puzzles are great for getting comfortable with new programming languages. I'd highly recommend trying the challenges out if you haven't already.

Feel free to check out my [2020 repo](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2020) which was also mostly Haskell. It got pretty difficult towards the end so this year I'm anticipating some serious spanners in the works, flies in the ointment, and what have you!
